Welcome to FWDMobileApplicationTesting — a powerful framework built for automated mobile application testing using Appium and Java! 🚀🧪

    🎯 Focused on delivering high-quality, maintainable, and scalable automation for Android and iOS applications.

📚 About the Project

FWDMobileApplicationTesting demonstrates a professional mobile automation framework to test mobile apps efficiently.
It covers essential features like:

    📱 Launching and controlling mobile apps

    🎯 Simulating real user actions (clicks, typing, gestures)

    🔍 Validating UI components and app behavior

    ⚡ Fast, repeatable test executions

Built with Appium and Java, it is designed to test both Android and (optionally) iOS apps.

Setup Instructions

    Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/omarelbably/FWDMobileApplicationTesting.git

    Navigate into the Project

cd FWDMobileApplicationTesting

    Install Dependencies

mvn clean install

    Configure Appium Server

    Start Appium server (appium in terminal or using Appium Desktop)

    Ensure your device or emulator is connected.

    Update Device/App Details

Modify capabilities in the project (usually in the DriverFactory.java or config file):

capabilities.setCapability("deviceName", "Android Emulator");
capabilities.setCapability("platformName", "Android");
capabilities.setCapability("app", "/path/to/your/app.apk");

    Run the Tests

mvn test

✅ Watch your app open and the tests execute automatically!
